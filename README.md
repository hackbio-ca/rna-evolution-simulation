## Abstract

The RNA world hypothesis asserts that self-replicating RNA polymers arose before DNA genome and coded proteins. Most of the literature on the origin of life focuses on chemical and biological approaches, so there is a greater need for statistical and computational models to simulate what the origin of life was like: specifically, the origins and evolution of self-replicating information polymers.

Some theoretical biologists have proposed computational origin of life models, such as Stuart Kauffman's autocatalytic sets and Manfred Eigen's quasispecies model, to describe the origin and evolution of replicating polymers. In Eigen's model, he defines a transition matrix that denotes the probability of a given k-mer mutating to another k-mer of equal length, constituting a Markov chain.

The central challenge of this project is as follows: construct a simulation of self-replicating RNA polymers and characterize its evolution over time, showing how new functions can emerge from selection acting on random mutational processes. This project has applications for mRNA design, mRNA therapeutics, and mRNA vaccines.
